Title: Disney Princess Quiz
Description: This is a quiz that will allow the user to determine which Disney princess they are through a series of questions asking about their hobbies and favorite colors.
110 programming concepts: In this project we used function definitions, boolean expressions, importing modules, object oriented programming, variable definition, global variables, if else statements, parameters, and operators.
Challenges overcome/ concepts learned: We had trouble trying to figure out api as well as css syntax to personalize the website. We had trouble with html syntax as well and making sure all of the parts of the project were connecting and importing properly. New concepts were how to use html, apis, css styling, and website development.
Team Members and contributions: Shefali Pai - CSS styling and api, Shreya Selvavel - HTML writing and function writing.
Goals achieved: We have produced a quiz that successfully returns a Disney princess according to user input while incorporating api's and object oriented programming.
Goals outstanding/ future work: We could consider adding more questions to the quiz to make it more complicated and also making the user interface easier to use. We could also consider adding open ended questions to the quiz.
